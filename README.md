# crypter_site
This is a project I'm working on with my son. He's learning Python and general coding, and I'm trying out Flask. The site, which allows numbers to be "encrypted" and "decrypted" (using an algorithm my son wrote at 11 years old) is complete but we haven't gotten around to deploying it to webserver yet.
